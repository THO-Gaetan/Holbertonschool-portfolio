# ðŸŽ® Project Charter â€“ IdleQuestLine

## Project Objectives

**Purpose:**  
The purpose of *IdleQuestLine* is to create a browser-based idle RPG that offers satisfying and strategic progression with minimal active gameplay. It serves both as an engaging game for casual players and a full-stack portfolio project for Gaetan Pineiro as part of the Holberton School curriculum.

**SMART Objectives:**
- Deliver a functional MVP with timer-based work systems and an adventure mode using Phaser.js and a Firebase or Node.js backend.
- Implement a user account and cloud save system to allow secure, persistent player progression across sessions.
- Provide a smooth user experience through an intuitive interface including inventory, character sheets, and progression menus.

## Identify Risks

| Risk                                          | Mitigation Strategy                                                  |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cheating via system clock manipulation        | Use server timestamps or store absolute start/end time               |
| Learning curve with Phaser.js or backend tools| Allocate research time and utilize templates and community docs      |
| Player churn due to idle monotony             | Implement frequent reward drops and unlockable progression elements  |
| Backend/storage costs                         | Use Firebaseâ€™s free tier or local storage as fallback                |
| Scope creep or overengineering                | Stick to core MVP objectives and iterative development approach      |
